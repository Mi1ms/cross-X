### Idea 01 / Collaborative Drawing App

This application’s main idea is to create the canvas element where users would be able t draw.

Let me tell you what’s needed in this app. You need to start by setting the Node JS application with Socket.io installed.

Then you need to add some HTML to prepare a simple interface with canvas element for users to draw, and you can style it any way you’d like. Then you have to handle the mouse events that will be drawing. 

And the last thing is to create the server-side code, where you’d use the Socket.io to check when new users join and when they start drawing.

### Idea 02 / Real-time Chat Application

The basic is to create a simple chat that will connect and disconnect users, allow them to send and receive the messages.
Then, the chat must handle client to client video streaming.

### Idea 03 / Collaborative text editor

Markdown is a way to style text on the web.
You control the display of the document. Formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, creating lists, etc., are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

The idea is a tiny collaborative "google doc" that understand markdown.
